Angular + Express + Sequelize
=============================
An app built with an [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) frontend and an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) + [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/documentation) (MySQL) backend.

Kickstarted with [Angular-Express-Seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed).

Not really much to see here just yet.
